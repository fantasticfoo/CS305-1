# CS305

Project CS305 is a project whose lofty, inspiring goal is to connect NAU students together into groups. These groups will be filled with like-minded students who collaborate with each other here on GitHub and on Slack. By reaching out to one another, organizing into groups, and investing the time and effort into helping other students with their assignments, we believe that project CS305 will have no bounds.

**NOTICE:** This project will be abandoned starting Monday, May 2, 2022.

## Modifications from forks
Not all modifications from forks will be accepted but at least one modification in a fork will be allowed. May the odds be ever in your favor.
